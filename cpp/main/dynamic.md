but pointer variables are static or automatic.

for built-in types a value-initialized object has a well-defined value 
defaullt-initialized object has an undefined value.
members of built-in type in classes that rely on the synthesized default constructor will also be uninitialized if those members are not initialized in the class body.

>For the same reasons as we usually initialize variables, it is also a good idea  
to initialize dynamically allocated objects.
