# copy constructor

used to copy an object to a newly created object.
`Class_name(const Class_name &);`

need to know when it's used and what it does.

used when: 
- a new object created and initialized with existing object of the same kind
- passed by value
- when compiler generates temporary objects

it does:
- member-by-member copy of the nonstatic members (by value)
