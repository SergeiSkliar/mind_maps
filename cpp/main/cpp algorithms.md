# 
algorithms never change the size of the underlying container - this is because STL algorithms operate in terms of iterators and NOT container operations.

headers:
[[algorithm]] for:
- nonmodifying sequence operations
- mutating sequence operations
- sorting and related operations
[[numeric]] for generalized numeric operations

[[C++ QuickSort]]


[[lambda expressions]]

[[algorithm parameter patterns]]

[[container-specific algorithms]]
