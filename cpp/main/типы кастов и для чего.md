reinterpret_cast - allows any pointer to be converted to any other pointer type. better to avoid this cast, unless the desired conversion is low level by nature


static_cast - (nonpolymorphic) 


dynamic_cast - (conversion of poly,orphic types) cast pointer or reference to derived class. along the inheritance hierarchy.


const_cast - to remove const, volatile and `__unaligned` attributes



const_cast and reinterpret_cast are very dangerous
