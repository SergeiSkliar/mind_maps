# compound types
compound types is a type that is defined in terms of another type

In [[declaration]], & and * are used to form compound types. In expressions,  
these same symbols are used to denote an operator. Because the same  
symbol is used with very different meanings, it can be helpful to ignore  
appearances and think of them as if they were different symbols.
