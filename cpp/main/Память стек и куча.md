the program is divided into many different areas of memory

*registers* - storage located inside processor.

*stack* - LIFO. It has a predefined size. stack allocation is very fast (perhaps one cpu instruction) - memory allocated on top of each other. move stack pointer and return its value.

*heap* - can grow.

*stack* and *heap* differ in memory allocation.

*constant storage* - ?

*Non-RAM storage* - usually data or object stored on disk (persistent data). should be tranformed to something that can exist on disk storage (and than transformed back to RAM-based form for using by a program). another example - streamed data.

*memory access* is a bottleneck (limiting factor)

one or more contiguous sequences of bytes

in C++ byte is large enough to hold:
- value of any UTF-8 code unit
- any member of the basic char set
- ordinary literal 

memory management problems - forget to free memory - *memory leak*. or free memory when there are still pointers referring to that memory.

*new* operator actually calls *malloc*
