constexpr - compile time
const - run time

for a func to be evaluated in constant expr it must be defined as constexpr

`constexpr double square(double x) { return x*x; }`

in a few places, const expressions are required by language rules:
- array bounds
- case labels
- template value arguments 
- constants declared via `const`
-
