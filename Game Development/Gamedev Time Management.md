Time management

Effective time management is critical to timely delivery and completion of the project. When managing projects:

-   Scope time for each phase of the design and development process.
-   Review your project plan daily, and give brief daily status reports to the project manager or producer (often these daily updates are called “stand-ups”).
-   Use contingency planning for any unforeseen delays; reprioritize and update the tasks and deliverables in your project plans when needed.
-   Identify which project planning and management tools are suitable for you or your team; when you’ve chosen them, use them consistently.
