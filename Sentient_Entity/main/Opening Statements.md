Penrose:
>Consciousness seems to me to be such an important phenomenon that I simply  
cannot believe that it is something lust accidentally" conjured up by a complicated computation.  
it is indeed obvious" that the conscious mind cannot work like a computer, even though much of what is actually involved in mental activity might  
do so.

Moravec:
>Today, our machines are still simple creations, requiring the parental care and  
hovering attention of any newborn, hardly worthy of the word "intelligent." But  
within the next century they will mature into entities as complex as ourselves,  
and eventually into something transcending everything we knowin whom we  
can take pride when they refer to themselves as our descendants. .  
We are very near to the time when virtually no essential human function, physical or mental, will lack an artificial counterpart. The embodiment of this convergence of cultural developments will be the intelligent robot, a machine that can  
think and act as a human.
