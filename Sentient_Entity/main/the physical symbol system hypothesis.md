every general intelligence must be realized by a symbolic system

this hypothesis claims that there must be a symbol system that accounts for all the observe intelligence in every intelligent agent.

could the physical symbol system implement any mental activity of a professional basketball player during a fast break.

>Since 1970 the Deliberative Thinking paradigm has dominated Artificial Intelligence research. Its main thesis is that intelligent tasks can be implemented by a  
reasoning process operating on a symbolic internal model. . . . This approach has  
proved successful in . . . areas such as expert level reasoning. However, only poor  
results have been obtained in its application to research on autonomous agents.  
The few systems built show deficiencies such as brittleness, inflexibility, no real  
time operation. . . . They also spawned a number of theoretical problems such as  
the frame problem26 and the problem of non-monotonic reasoning27 which remain unsolved (at least within realistic time constraints). Some researchers view  
this as evidence that it is unrealistic to hope that more action.oriented tasks could  
also be successfully implemented by a deliberative machine in real time.
