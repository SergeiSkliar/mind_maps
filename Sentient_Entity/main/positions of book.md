1. Mind is rather continuous, not Boolean (no switch "Mind On/Mind Off")
2. Mind is aggregate rather than monolithic
3. Mind is enabled by a multitude of disparate mechanisms
4. the overriding task of mind is to produce the next action (minds are properties of autonomous agents)
5. Mind operates on sensations to **create** information for its own use. - Information doesn't exist by itself - it rather "created" by mind processing its sensations
6. Mind uses prior information (memories) to produce action by a reconstructve process rather than by retrieval.
7. Mind, to some degree, is implementable on machines.
