>Does either of these anecdotes give evidence of intentional cooperation? Reasonable opinions could surely differ. But Griffin was fortunate  
enough to witness a scenario even more suggestive of intentional cooperation. A group of five lionesses approached two groups of wildebeest separated by a road. Two lionesses mounted ant hills so as to be clearly visible  
but pose no threat. A third crept along a ditch paralleling the road until  
she was between the two bands of wildebeest. Then a fourth lioness  
charged out of the woods adjacent to the leftmost band, driving them  
across the road toward the other band. The lioness in the ditch easily  
killed one wildebeest as it jumped the ditch. All five then began to feed.

honeybees:
>Honeybees use symbolic gestures to direct  
their companions toward food when they perform their waggle dance.  
The direction to the food is signaled symbolically in relation to the current position of the sun! The dance conveys not only the direction of the  
food but its distance and desirability as well

weaver ant
>When one returns  
with food, it will rub antennae with another worker in the nest, and make  
a side-to-side head movement. The news  
may not always be of food but rather of enemies. In this case, the head movement is back-to-front and jerky.

>The content and complexity of conscious thought, and their range of  
versatility, might be roughly proportional to the volume of the central nervous  
system, but an absolute criterion of mass necessary for conscious thinking is not  
supported by anything we know about the nature and functioning of central nervous systems.
