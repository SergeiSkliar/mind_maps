Sixth Generation Computing - Derek Stubbs

*insight:*
*if a human stops adapting then he stops evolving* - in context of evolution as learning
[[if a human stops adapting then he stops evolving]]

7 leaps by Derek Stubbs:
1. life itself
2. sexual reproduction
3. multicell organisms (eukaryots)
4. specialized nervous cells
5. central nervous system
6. computers (artificial neural networks)
7. future step: genetic engineering, environment engineering, life-computer symbiosis.

Quote
>Then nothing happened for half a billion years until one creature invented computers and shortly thereafter, the sixth step of evolution was invented as artificial neural networks: artificial learning machines. Life was becoming a going 
concern and was really in business to start shaping the Universe. Competitors  
such as rocks and gravity and earth, wind, and fire were taking a distinctly second place.
