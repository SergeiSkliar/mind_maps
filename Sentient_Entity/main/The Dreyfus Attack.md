Theory in this context is a collection of rules describing behavior within the domain?

Not every domain is rule describable?

[[Dreyfus's 5 stages of learning]]

Dreyfus believes that human experts typically choose the behavior that usually works via similarity recognition, without rules -> contradiction to the physical symbol system hypothesis of Simon and Newell.
