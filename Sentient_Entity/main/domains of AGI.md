Kai-Fu Lee:

Getting to AGI would require a series of foundational scientific breakthroughs in AI, a string of advances on the scale of, or greater than, deep learning. These breakthroughs would need to remove key constraints on the "narrow AI" programs that we run today, and empower them with a wide array of new abilities: multi-domain learning, domain-independent learning, natural-language understanding, commonsense reasoning, planning, and learning from a small number of examples.

  

Taking the next step to emotionally intelligent robots may require self-awareness, humor, love, empathy, and appreciation for beauty. These are the key hurdles that separate what narrow AI does today â€“ spotting correlations in data and making predictions.
