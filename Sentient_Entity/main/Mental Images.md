at least two different kinds of mental representation:

QUASI-LINGUISTIC representations are complex symbols, with meanings jointly determined by syntactic structure and the interpretations of their simple constituents (e.g., English sentences, AI "stereotypes," computer programs).

QUASI-PICTORIAL representations "depict" their objects by resembling or mimicking them in some way that's hard to characterize; but pictures, scale models, and (perhaps) mental images are prime examples.
