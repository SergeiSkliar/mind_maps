1) the *novice* uses rules, by a teacher and with their help, context-free
2) *beginner* recognizes new situational aspects
3) a *competent* - examines only situational features that are relevant to the selected goals or plan
4) a *proficient* - doesn't need to examine anymore but sees directly what is relevant, i.e. he or she decides consciously what to do and what not at this point
5) the *expert* - just does it.

>When things are going well experts do not solve problems or make inferences or  
figure Out anything at all; they simply do what normally works and it normally  
works.  
experience-based, holistic, similarity recognition produces the deep situational understanding of the proficient performer. No new insight is needed to  
explain the mental processes of the expert.

Experiment:
