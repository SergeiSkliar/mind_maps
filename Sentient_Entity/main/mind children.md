Hans Moravec - Mind Children
   
  >Today, our machines are still simple creations, requiring the parental care and  
hovering attention of any newborn, hardly worthy of the word "intelligent." But  
within the next century they will mature into entities as complex as ourselves,  
and eventually Into something transcending everything we knowin whom we  
can take pride when they refer to themselves as our descendants. (1988, p. 1)

>We are very near to the time when virtually no essential human function, physical  
or mental, will lack an artificial counterpart. The embodiment of this convergence  
of cultural developments will be the intelligent robot, a machine that can think  
and act as a human. (1988, p. 2)
