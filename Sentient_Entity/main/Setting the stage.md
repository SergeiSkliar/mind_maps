scoffers or boosters?

Penrose, the Emperor's New Mind:
> With thought comprising a non-computational element, computers can never do  
what we human beings can.

John Haugland (known to me for [[000 AI the Very Idea]]):
>The fundamental goal of this research is not merely to mimic intelligence or produce some clever fake. Not at all. 'AI" wants only the genuine article: machines  
with minds, in the full and literal sense. .  
Scoffers find the whole idea quite preposterousnot just false but ridiculouslike imagining that your car (really) hates you or insisting that a murderous bullet  
should go to jail.  
Boosters . . are equally certain that it's only a matter of time; computers with  
minds, they say, are as inevitable as interplanetary travel and two-way pocket TV.
