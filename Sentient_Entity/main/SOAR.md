Newell "Unified Theories of Cognition"

SOAR DOESN'T have:
- deliberate planning facility
- automatic task acquisition
- several important learning techniques (analysis, instruction, example)
- can't forget or unlearn
- real-time interaction with outer world

Soar objects are like Minsky's frames and objects of OOP, lacking default values, attachments or procedures, and inheritance.
