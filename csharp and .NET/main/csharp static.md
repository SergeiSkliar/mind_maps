same as in C++

make it possible to access methods and fields of the class without having to create an instance of the class.

class can be `static` - `static` class can contain only `static` fields, properties, etc.
```cs
static class MyClass
{
	public static int a = 0;
	public static int B {get; set;}
}
```
