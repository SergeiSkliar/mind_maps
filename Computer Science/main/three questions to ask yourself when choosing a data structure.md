- Are all data items inserted into the data structure at the beginning, or are insertions interspersed with other operations? Static applications (where the data are loaded at the beginning and never change) typically require only simpler data structures to get an efficient implementation than do dynamic applications.  
- Can data items be deleted? If so, this will probably make the implementation more complicated.  
- Are all data items processed in some well-defined order, or is search for specific data items allowed? “Random access” search generally requires more complex data structures.
