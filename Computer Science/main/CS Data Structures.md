Representing information is fundamental to Computer Science.
The primary purpose of most computer programs is not to perform calculations, but to store and retrive information - usually as fast as possible.

data structure is any data representation and its associated operations.

A solution is said to be **efficient** if it solves the problem within the required  
**resource constraints**.
