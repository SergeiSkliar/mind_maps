# 
### multiple languages in one source file
### obvious behavior is unimplimented
### incorrect behavior at the boundaries
#### don't rely on your intuition
### overriden safeties
### duplication
#### [[Software Engineering/main/DRY]]
### code at wrong level of abstraction
### base classes depending on their derivatives
 there are exceptions - e.g. finite state machine.

### too much information
### dead code
### vertical separation
### inconsistency
### clutter
### artificial coupling
### feature invy
### selector arguments
### obscured intent
### misplaced responsibility
### inapropriate static
### use explanatory variables
### function names should say what they do
### understand the algorithm
### make logical dependencies physical
### prefer [[polymorphism]] to if/else or switch/case
### follow standard conventions
### replace magic numbers with named constants
### be precise
### structure over convention
### [[Software Engineering/main/encapsulate conditionals]]
### [[Software Engineering/main/avoid negative conditionals]]
### [[Software Engineering/main/functions should do one thing]]
### hidden temporal couplings
### don't be arbitrary
### [[Software Engineering/main/encapsulate boundary conditions]]
### functions should descend only one level of abstraction
### keep configurable data at high levels
### [[Software Engineering/main/avoid transitive navigation]]
