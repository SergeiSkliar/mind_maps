# 
**Fast** - tests should be fast. they should run quickly

**Independent** - tests should not depend on each other.

**Repeatable** - repeatable in any environment.

**Self-Validating** - tests should have a boolean output. either they pass or fail.

**Timely** - tests should be written just before the production code.
